# Project Notebooks Overview

This repository contains two key Jupyter notebooks that explore advanced techniques in deep learning, specifically focusing on **Transfer Learning** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**. These notebooks provide practical implementations and insights into key areas of modern machine learning.

## 1. **Working with Existing Models and Transfer Learning**

### Notebook:

### Description:
This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to applying **transfer learning** using pretrained models, specifically **VGG16**, for custom tasks. It explores the steps needed to fine-tune these models for specific datasets and maximize performance even when the amount of labeled data is limited.

### Key Features:
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes the VGG16 model pretrained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and adapts it to a smaller custom dataset.
- **Model Modification**: Demonstrates how to freeze and unfreeze layers for selective retraining to balance between retaining learned features and customizing the model.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Includes examples of performance metrics such as accuracy and loss, showcasing how transfer learning can significantly reduce training time while maintaining high accuracy.

### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Loading Pretrained Models**: Importing VGG16 and modifying the output layers to suit the specific classification task.
- **Fine-Tuning Layers**: Explanation of which layers are frozen and

  which are retrained to adapt to the new dataset.
- **Data Augmentation**: Using techniques like random rotations, flips, and zoom to prevent overfitting on small datasets.
- **Model Training**: Walks through the training process using **Adam optimizer** and evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.

### Target Audience:
- **Machine Learning Practitioners** interested in leveraging pretrained models for image classification tasks.
- **Researchers and Students** who want to understand the practical applications of transfer learning for projects with limited datasets.

### Applications:
This notebook is particularly useful for image classification problems where the availability of labeled data is limited, but pretrained models can be fine-tuned to improve accuracy and reduce training time.

## 2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) on MNIST**

### Notebook: 

### Description:
This notebook focuses on **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** and their application to the **MNIST dataset** for unsupervised learning tasks. It demonstrates the entire pipeline from building the encoder and decoder, through training the VAE, to generating new images from the learned latent space.

### Key Features:
- **VAE Architecture**: Explains the core components of a VAE, including the encoder, latent space (with the reparameterization trick), and the decoder.
- **Latent Space Representation**: Shows how the latent space captures meaningful representations of input data, and how to sample from it to generate new images.
- **Reconstruction and Generation**: Evaluates the VAEâ€™s ability to reconstruct input images and generate new ones from random samples in the latent space.

### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Encoder and Decoder**: 
  - The **encoder** compresses input images into a lower-dimensional latent space. 
  - The **decoder** reconstructs the original image from this latent space.
- **Reparameterization Trick**: Ensures that the model can backpropagate through stochastic nodes by sampling latent variables from learned distributions.
- **Sampling and Generation**: The VAE can generate new images that resemble the input data by sampling from the latent space.
- **Loss Function**: Uses the **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**, combining **reconstruction loss** and **KL divergence** to regularize the latent space.

### Applications:
- **Generative Modeling**: VAEs are useful for generating new data, and this notebook demonstrates their capabilities using MNIST digit images.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: VAEs can be applied for unsupervised learning tasks where latent representations are used to compress data.

### Future Work:
- **Improving Reconstruction**: Future improvements could focus on applying these techniques to more complex datasets.
- **Exploring Other Architectures**: Expanding the use of generative models like **GANs** for further improvements in image reconstruction.
